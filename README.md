# NETLUME

## TAKE HOME PROJECT

### FRONT-END ENGINEER

---

## INSTRUCTIONS

This is a simple Flask API that you can run on your machine to get the JSON files that you need to build the Front-end Engineer take home project.

Read this entire document to know the requirements, how to setup the API and the UI/UX specification.

If you have doubts or face any issues, please send an email to marcos.medeiros@netlume.io with details of your situation so we can try and help you get through these problems.

---

## REQUIREMENTS

### PYTHON 3
In case you don't have python 3 already installed, refer to their [official guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### PIP
After installing python you can install pip following their [official getting started guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/).

---

## SETUP

To get the API up and running, clone this repository and run from the root directory 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After pip finishes installing the required packages, start the API running

```
python3 endpoints.py
```

The API provides you with 3 endpoints and all of them will respond with static JSON files:

### 1. `/`

The home endpoint wich will send you a standard success response to confirm that the API is working.

```
    // API response
    {
        status: 'success',
        data: {
            message: 'Netlume's take home project API is up and running.'
        }
    }
```

### 2. `/treeview`

The tree view endpoint will return you a nested object in a tree structure.

```
    // PhysicalComponent
    {
        children: {
            1: PhysicalComponent,
            2: PhysicalComponent
            3: PhysicalComponent
            ...
        };
        connection: string;
        is_a: string;
        name: string;
        uuid: string;
    }

    // API response
    {
      data: {
        1: PhysicalComponent,
      status: "success"
    }
```

### 3. `/mapview`

The map view endpoint will return you a collection of GeoJSON features.

```
    // GeoJSONFeature
    {
        geometry: {
            coordinates: [number, number][];
            type: 'LineString';
        };
        properties: {
            color: string;
            info: {
                diameter: number;
                length: number;
            };
            parent_uuid: string;
            uuid: string;s
        },
        type: 'Feature';
    }

    // API response
    {
      features: GeoJSONFeature[];
      type: 'FeatureCollection';
    }
```

*The API will be exposed on http://localhost:5000/*

## UI/UX SPECIFICATION

There are two project features for this take home project: Tree View and Map View. You can choose to submit any of the two or both as long as you are still inside the deadline.

**IMPORTANT: All submissions should be developed in React and Typescript.**

### Tree view

Given the nested `PhysicalComponent` object that you'll retrieve from the `/treeview` endpoint of this API, build an user interface in which all of the tree nodes are displayed in a tree-like structure.

#### Requirements

- You should use D3 and/or React D3 libraries to build the tree visualization.

- The nodes should be connected by a line/link and the user should be able to see the parent/child connection type in a clear way.

- Nodes should display data that easily identifies the class they belong to and their name.

- User should be able to remove existing connections/nodes and also add new connections/nodes.

- All data should be fetched from the API. No hard-coded data.


### Map view

Given the GeoJSON Feature Collection that you'll retrieve from the `/mapview` endpoint of this API, build an user interface in which all of GeoJSON features are displayed on an interactive map.

#### Requirements

- You should use Leaflet.js and/or React Leaflet libraries to build the map component.

- User should be able to see all map elements in a default color.

- User should be able to see all map elements with the custom color defined in the `color` property of each GeoJSONFeature properties object.

- When a given map element is hovered, the map element should be highlighted so the user can identify an individual map element.

- When a given map element is clicked, a popup displays the data inside the `info` property of each GeoJSONFeature and the its `uuid`.

- The map should automatically center on the map elements upon initialization.

- All data should be fetched from the API. No hard-coded data.

## NICE-TO-HAVE'S

If you're commited and want to achieve high marks, be mindful to:

- Write clean and readable code.

- Use a linter and code formatter.

- Create type and interface definitions for functions, arguments and components.

- Write comments **ONLY** where the code is complex enough to make it necessary.

- Write tests for the component.
